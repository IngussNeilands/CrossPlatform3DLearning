When exporting the models to Wavefront .obj files,
make sure you set the options "Include Normals",
"Triangulate Faces", and "Keep Vertex Order".
The model has to have been set to have smooth
shading in Blender and double vertices have
to have been deleted before the export.
Otherwise, when rendering with shaders, lighting
will not work, since there will be multiple
normals for each vertex and, with indexed drawing,
the normals listed later in the exported file
for some vertices will overwrite the previous
ones.
If a texture has been created, the option "Include
UVs" must also be set.
